      <h3>What even is a cockerel?</h3>
      <p>While a rooster is an adult male bird, a cockerel is a younger male (a chicken is a lady bird). It is an Italian specialty.</p>
      <h3>It's organic!</h3>
      <p>The cockerel you find at our restaurant comes from the Italian Alps. They are sustainably-raised in large spaces, with mountain air and clean water, making them 100% BIO.</p>
      <p>Each cockerel served weighs approximately 500 grams and is the perfect serving size for one person.</p>
